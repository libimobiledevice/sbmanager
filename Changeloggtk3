This is a change log for sbmanager to GTK3  


Sbmanager version = 0.1.2

Change All Clutter deprecated functions to bring it up to clutter 1.14.4.
There was a lot of deprecated functions as the Clutter API has changed a lot.

Change code for all compiler warnings for both GTK3 and minor libimobiledevice 
library calls and function arguments.

At this point the code compiled using gcc but the application failed to run due
to gtk2 and gtk3 library available.  

For development test remove GTK2 library from development system
to ensure the application still runs. The application should operate
with both gtk2 and gtk3 libraries available but at the moment I have removed it
from the development system to concentrate on changes above and debugging of code
in general. This may have been a bug in gtk2 library.

Recompile using only gtk3 library installed.

The application failed to run due to Gmutex locks and these where removed in the code
but a review will be done when the code base is stable to ensure that in the areas
that the Gmutex where removed that this does not cause stability issues. At this time
debugger sessions indicated that the application is stable with the Gmutex locks removed.

The initial test of the application failed to run due to Gmutex locks and unlocks
    although some of the library used are thread safe or their functions are thread safe
    this file is a reminder to review the source code when development reaches a stable
    code base.


    The Glib threading system is automatically initialised at the start of the program
    Ref: - Glib Reference manual - Glib is thread safe

    GMutex Locks
    Clutter threading support is initialized when Clutter is initialized 
    Ref : Clutter Reference Manual


Thread code functions was altered to include a name for debugging and due to deprecated functions.

A callback function was fixed that allowed the icons to load to the stage

Deprecated timing functions and Clutter callback functions altered were necessary.

At this point the application ran but did not load any initial Gui image data files.

Further clutter code was added to load icons, and needs further cleanup and proper error code
handling .

Clutter code was added to the gui.c file for initial gui image files load but failed due to not
setting the size of the images in clutter,further cleanup and error code handling still to be 
done.

Lots of debugging code added around Clutter functions to isolate Clutter critical run time errors
or for debugging code in general.

Gui-init - added error handling for new image file loading code.

Fixed background color for folders, gui fade in/out and spinner routines and
battery display which had not been altered in the original Clutter code update.

Code review for all clutter code to ensure correct functions are being used and arguments are correct
after finding several clutter actor functions and/or arguments that were not correct.

Trouble-shooting of icon why the are not following the mouse position when selected. WIP

Trouble-shooting why folders are not being opened and closed correctly. WIP
NOTE:check code in areas for commented out reparenting functions as folders were opening.

Added comments to top of functions in gui.c to better understand their intent for trouble-shooting. WIP

Refactoring code in several functions which are quite complicated for what they achieve. WIP

Sbmanager version = 0.1.6

Updated to clutter version 1.14.4.4 for Gnome 3.8 on Fedora 19 This resulted in the Gui paging code working correctly.

Sbmanager version = 0.1.8

Started update to clutter version 1.2.4, clutter-gtk 1.6.6 for Gnome 3.18.5 with gtk3 3.18.5 01/12/15 for Fedora 23. Minor updates to C Code and configure.ac

iconshadow.png file added to makefile.am to ensure it is installed in correct directory

Sbmanager version = 0.2.0

gapplication code added for dbus activation for gnome 3  

application runs on X window server as well as wayland
