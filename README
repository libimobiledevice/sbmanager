SBManager
----------
Timothy Ward <gtwa001@gmail.com>

This application works on gnome3 X11 and gnome-on-wayland.

This code relies heavy on libimobiledevice communication
and uses double linked Glist's for indexing and holding info.
It is not really suited for beginners as the learning curve will be
steep to gasp the concepts as well as learn the Clutter API.
But this is up to you to decide. 

Because it was experimental/proof of concept code there 
are many areas were the code could be refactored to 
suit the application better and make it simpler- 
using both Clutter and rewriting the backend operation to 
the phone etc. It does have some smart sections coded into it
and the original authors should be proud of there achievement.
 
This code is for gtk3 for Gnome3= 3.18.5 with code updated for clutter-1.24.2.

This is experimental code only and still unstable in some areas.
This is a development fork only - Use at your own risk.

This fork does not have all the features below at present.
